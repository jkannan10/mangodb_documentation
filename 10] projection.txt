Projection :

 When selecting a document it shows all the field in the document.
 When we want to show only specific details while retriving the data we can achieve it by on and off the fields.

	db.collectionname.find({"tax":{$gt: 300}} , {"name":1 , "_id" : 1});

it only shows name and _id field in a document
