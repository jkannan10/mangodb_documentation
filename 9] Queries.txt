Mixing Operators :



Certainly! Let's consider a hypothetical scenario where you have a collection named employees with documents representing employee records.
Each document might have fields such as name, department, and salary.


               Retrieve all documents from the employees collection where the department is "Sales" and the salary is greater than $50,000.
               
		Soln:

                    db.employees.find( {"department":"Sales"} ,{"salary" : { $gt : 50000} );



Using and and or :
		
               Retrieve documents from the employees collection where either the department is "Sales" and the salary is greater than $50,000, or the department is "Marketing."

     db.employees.find( 
			{ $or:[
				{ $and:{"dept" : "Sales"},{"salary" : {$gt : 50000} } ,
				       {"dept" : "marketing"}
			      ] 
			}
		     );

Using AND , OR , gte , lte , eq :

		 Retrieve documents from the products collection where the price is either greater than or equal to $50 and less than or equal to $100, and the quantity is equal to 10.
		 OR the category is "Electronics."

	db.products.find(
				{ $or : [ 
						{ $and : [ 
								{"price" : {$gte : 50 , $lte : 100}} ,
								{"quantity" : {$eq : 10 }}
							 ] 
						} ,
						{"category" : "Electronics"} 
					]
				}
